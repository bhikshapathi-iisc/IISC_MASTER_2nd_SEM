Project Title:

A Magnetometer-Driven Alert System for Asset Protection & Anti-Theft Systems

Team Members and Contributions:

Deepti Sahu (ID: 25071)

Data preprocessing, label encoding, initial model development (Decision Tree, SVM)

Assisted in integration with Edge Impulse platform.

Kaniki Bhikshapathi (ID: 24489)

Led model experimentation with Random Forest, LSTM, and GRU

Handled confusion matrix analysis and evaluation metrics.

Puli Suhas Reddy (ID: 24123)

Finalized 1D CNN implementation and INT8 quantization

Deployed the model onto the microcontroller with live alert functionality using LED and Bluetooth modules.
